On the Make Reservation page, a customer enters their name, phone number, email, and selects the barber, date, and time for the reservation. 

On the Barber Portal, all upcoming reservations can be viewed, and may also be filtered by barber. All reservations are sorted by date, and all past reservations are set to not be displayed. Reservations can be updated by clicking the edit button, and canceled by clicking the x button.

The app uses its own RESTful API. A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. This functionality is also known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
